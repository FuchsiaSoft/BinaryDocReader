Binary Doc Reader - WIP
=========
Binary doc reader will (when finished) be a simple assembly that returns the body of a Word binary (.doc, 2003 and prior) file as a single string.

**Some parts of the source, particularly the XML comments inside the Internals classes are taken from MSDN for convenience inside this library, the full details can be viewed here: [Understanding the Word .doc Binary File Format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/gg615596(v=office.14).aspx)**
